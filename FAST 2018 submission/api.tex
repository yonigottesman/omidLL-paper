\sys\ is a \emph{Transaction Processing System (TPS)}, namely a service that runs atop an underlying data store and 
allows users to bundle multiple data store operations into a single atomic transaction. 
The TPS architecture is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:components}.
We describe the data model and API of the underlying data store in Section~\ref{ssec:data-model}, and 
then proceed to define  the transaction semantics provided by \sys\ in Section~\ref{ssec:transactions}.

\subsection{Data store}
\label{ssec:data-model}

The  data store holds  \emph{objects} (often referred to as \emph{rows}) identified by unique \emph{keys}.
Each row can consist of multiple \emph{fields}, representing different \emph{columns}. 
We consider multi-versioned objects, where object values are associated with \emph{version numbers}, and
multiple versions associated with the same key may co-exist in the data store.
\remove{
Thus, at any given time, an object holds a tuple \tuple{key,\tuple{version,value}+}, where value
can be structured to consist of multiple columns.
}
We further assume that a write operation can specify the version number it writes to.

%\paragraph{API} 
The  data store provides the following API:
\begin{description}
\item [\code{get(key, version)}] --  Returns the requested version of the requested key.
%if no version is provided, returns the latest; 
%if no field is provided returns the entire record. 
%\item 
The API further allows traversing (reading) earlier versions of the same key in descending order.
\item [\code{update}(key, version, fields, values)] -- 
creates or updates an object, setting the specified fields to the specified values. 
If the version already exists, its value is updated; otherwise, a new version is added. 
The data store may buffer the write in memory until an ensuing flush. 
\item [\code{remove(key, version)}] -- removes an object with the given key and version.
\item [\code{check\&mutate}(key, version, field, old, new)] -- checks the record associated with key and version. 
If field holds old, replace it with new   and return true; otherwise return false.
\item [\code{flush}] -- persists all previous updates to disk.
%data stores often provide means to atomically read and update a single object, e.g., HBase exports check\&mutate operations, which are 
%internally implemented using a per-row RW lock.
%, whereas BigTable supports row transactions. 
%We will extend this capability below in order to implement certain atomic operations at the data store level.

A separate process performs garbage collection of obsolete versions.

\subsection{Transaction semantics} \label{ssec:transactions}

TPSs provide \emph{begin} and \emph{commit} APIs for delineating transactions: 
a \emph{transaction} the sequence of read and write operations on different objects 
that occur between begin and commit. A TPS  ensures the ACID properties for transactions:
\emph{atomicity} (all-or-nothing), \emph{consistency} (preserving each object's semantics), 
\emph{isolation} (in that concurrent transactions do not see each other's partial updates), and 
\emph{durability} (whereby updates survive crashes).

Different isolation levels can be considered for the third property. We consider 
snapshot isolation~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95}, 
which is provided by popular database technologies such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server,
and TPSs such as Percolator, Omid, Tephra, and  CockroachDB.

Intuitively, SI ensures that the data a transaction reads from the database 
does not mix old and new values. For example, if a task updates the values of two stocks, then no other transaction may observe the old value of one of these stocks and the new value of the other. 
%
More precisely, 
}
SI enforces a total order on committed transactions according to their commit times so that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parsep}{2pt}  
\item
each transaction's read operations see a consistent snapshot of the database reflecting write operations by
 exactly those transactions that committed prior to the transaction's start time; and 
\item
 a transaction commits only if none of the items it updates has been modified since that snapshot.
 \end{enumerate}
Thus, under SI, two concurrent transactions conflict only if they both \emph{update} the same item.  
In contrast, under serializability, a transaction that updates an item also conflicts with transactions that \emph{read} that item. Snapshot isolation is thus amenable to implementations (using multi-versioning) that 
allow more concurrency than serializable ones, and hence scale better.

Following a commit call, the transaction may successfully \emph{commit}, whereby all of its operations take effect;
in case of conflicts, (i.e., when two concurrent transactions attempt to update the same item), the transaction may
\emph{abort}, in which case none of its changes take effect. 
%An abort may also be initiated by the programmer, e.g., 
%on encountering an error. Applications typically retry a transaction upon  abort. 


%%%The data is \emph{partitioned} (or sharded), and each object belongs to one region. 
%%%%Global transactions may span multiple regions, and atomically commit or abort on all. 
%%%\emph{Local transactions} are ones that access a single region.
