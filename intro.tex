NOSQL key-value stores such as BigTable, HBase, and RocksDB have increased in popularity over the past few years, and are now very widely deployed. Yet in many installations, the single-key access offered by these data stores is insufficient; developers  increasingly require 
 \emph{ACID} (atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable) \emph{transactions} that access multiple keys.
 (Transaction API and semantics are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:api}).
This need is addressed by a number of popular  \emph{transaction processing systems (TPSs)} 
such as  Percolator~\cite{Percolator2010}, Omid~\cite{OmidICDE2014,omid-blog}, Tephra~\cite{tephra}, and CockroachDB~\cite{cockroach}, 
which offer transactions on top of  BigTable~\cite{bigtable-osdi06}, HBase~\cite{hbase}, HBase, and RocksDB~\cite{rocksdb}, resp. 
(In the context of this paper, we consider only TPSs that are layered atop a stand-alone key-value store). 
The underlying NOSQL stores are typically distributed  over multiple \emph{regions} (sometimes called nodes, shards, domains, or partitions).
The main purpose of a TPS is to support \emph{global transactions}, i.e., ones that span multiple regions.

The need to atomically perform multiple  updates  entails a two-phase design, whereby transactions first indicate their \emph{intent} to write certain values, and then atomically \emph{commit} (or \emph{abort}) all their write intents at the same time. In addition, 
all the values written by a single transaction are associated with a common  \emph{timestamp} (or \emph{version number}). 
Reads, in turn, rely on these timestamps in order to read a consistent snapshot of the data store. They further  
require some mechanism (either centralized or distributed) to determine what to do on encountering a write intent.

A TPS also implements  a \emph{validation} or \emph{conflict detection} mechanism in order to ensure transaction isolation, which can mean
either serializability or snapshot isolation (SI) ~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BerensonBGMOO95}; we focus here on the
latter (see Section~\ref{sec:api}) ,  which is popular in real-world systems  and amenable to scalable implementations.
Conflicting transactions that would violate the required isolation level are
aborted. Conflicts are checked at commit time, and possibly during write-write conflicts.

Transaction processing thus follows the general schema outlined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:schema}, 
while systems vary in their implementations of each of the steps. 
For example, whereas most systems rely on a centralized service (requiring remote access) for timestamp allocation~\cite{OmidICDE2014,omid-blog,tephra,Percolator2010}, this is not essential~\cite{cockroach}; similarly, validation (conflict detection) can use a centralized service~\cite{OmidICDE2014,omid-blog,tephra}, per-transaction entries in a global table~\cite{cockroach}, or two-phase commit~\cite{Percolator2010}. 
Different ways to implement this schema are  discussed in Section~\ref{sec:context}.

\If{validate(write-set, $ts_2$)}  \Comment check for conflicts  \label{l:validate}
	\Statex \Comment commit all write intents with version $ts_2$
	\State atomically and persistently indicate commit   \label{l:commit}
\Else
	\State abort	
\EndIf
\State clean-up write intents and other meta-data
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm} 

The two-phase transaction processing schema induces high overhead, especially on short transactions. For example, a transaction writing a single key (and reading none) goes through the following stages:  
(1) \emph{begin} to obtain a tentative timestamp, in most implementations from a centralized service;  
(2) add \emph{write intent} to the data store; 
(3) \emph{get commit timestamp}, typically using a centralized service, (though in some cases, the tentative timestamp is used);
(4) \emph{validate} (conflict detection), using a centralized service or two-phase locking; 
(5) \emph{indicate commit}, sometimes at the data store and sometimes at a global table; and 
(6) \emph{clean-up} -- replace write intent with actual write in the data store. 
The overhead is exacberated by 
the fact that some of these steps involve access to centralized services, which, in a large deployment, are remote most of the time.

In this work we expedite   \emph{local transactions}, namely,  transactions that span a single region, in particular, short ones. We
introduce a \emph{fast path} for such transactions, which mitigates this overhead
without a significant impact on global (multi-region) transactions.
The concept is generic and is applicable to a family of TPSs that use the schema of Section~\ref{sec:context}, 
including Percolator~\cite{Percolator2010}, Omid 1~\cite{OmidICDE2014}, Omid 2~\cite{omid-blog}, Tephra~\cite{tephra}, 
and CockroachDB~\cite{cockroach}. 
In Section~\ref{sec:new-api} we define API extensions for fast local transactions, 
and in Section~\ref{sec:alg}, we consider  a generic TPS that supports global transactions, 
and enhance it with optimized support for specific types of local transactions. 
Our main goal is to expedite short single-object transactions,
which are popular in production web workloads~\cite{omid-blog}.

A second contribution of this paper is building  a new low-latency transaction processing system, \sys, presented in Section~\ref{sec:lorra},
where we embody the fast path concept.  
\sys\ is based on the open-source version of Omid 2~\cite{omid-blog}, a transaction processing engine for HBase, 
but replaces its centralized commit table access with a lower-latency distributed approach to indicating commits.  
\sys\ supports local transactions via (1) distributed timestamp allocation; (2) extensions to the underlying key-value store API; 
and (3) an extended client-side transaction library. 
We implement (1) and (2) in HBase region servers, and (3) based on the Omid client library.

TPS design is typically optimized for global transactions, and they typically employ some centralized component to facilitate their coordination. 
For example, Omid and Tephra use a centralized \emph{Transaction Manager (TM)} 
(also called \emph{Transaction Status Oracle (TSO)}) for (1) allocating global timestamps; (2) conflict detection; 
and (3) tracking committed transactions in a global table, 
whereas  Percolator uses a centralized timestamp oracle for the first 
and CockroachDB uses a global \emph{Transaction Table (TT)} for the last. 
Common to all these systems is the use of globally-meaningful timestamps, either provided by the centralized TM (Omid, Tephra) or oracle (Percolator), or maintained using a causality-enforcing clock synchronization protocol (in CockroachDB).
Note that these are different from federated systems, where transactions are by default local, i.e.,
access a single region, and lock-based (blocking) protocols like two phase commit are used to ensure atomicity of global transactions.

Optimizing for global transactions introduces a tradeoff: while transactions spanning
multiple regions are greatly facilitated and expedited using this design, local
transactions incur a performance penalty. This penalty is particularly
significant for short transactions, where the overhead of accessing 
a centralized entity for obtaining a timestamp, logging the transaction in a common table, or detecting conflicts 
is not amortized across many operations. Typical web workloads include both long
multi-region transactions and short local transactions, including ones
consisting of a single object read, write, or read-modify-write.

In this work we mitigate the above tradeoff by offering a \emph{fast path} for short
local transactions, without a significant impact on multi-region ones, while
maintaining correctness. We consider a TPS that supports global
transactions, and enhance it with optimized support for specific types of local
transactions. Our main goal is to expedite short single-object transactions,
which are popular in production web workloads~\cite{sieve}.
